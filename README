This is a completion source for the ``auto-complete`` bundle of Emacs. It act as an backend providing completion hints to auto-complete bundle by capturing Clang's output.

Install Prerequisite
====================

* auto-complete

auto-complete-clang act as a completion-source of auto-complete. So make sure you have installed auto-complete bundle for Emacs, and well configured it. For further information please refer to ``http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/``

* clang (>= 2.9 for C++ support)

Make sure clang is installed, since auto-complete-clang relies on Clang's ``code-completion-at`` parameter. 

You can get clang's svn trunk from here: ``http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html#build``

Install and Configure
=====================

Put the ``auto-complete-clang.el`` file under the ``load-path``, so that Emacs will find it using ``(require 'auto-complete-clang)``. Since auto-complete-clang will invoke a clang process everytime a completion is triggered, you have to do some tweak for auto-complete. Please refer to the ``sample-config.el``.

A sample configure file for c-basic-mode is given, please refer to ``sample-config.el``.
